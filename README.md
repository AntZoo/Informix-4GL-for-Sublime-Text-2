# INFORMIX 4GL PACKAGE FOR SUBLIME TEXT 2

This is my first public git repository. It'll get better over time. :)

Otherwise, the package is for Sublime Text 2. I work with Informix 4gl and have written basic support for it for Sublime Text 2, the best code editor out there. ;) The support is "basic" as in: 1) a couple of snippets, 2) 40% of syntax is sorted into groups for highlighting.

As I learn new things about the language I will update this package. Plus, there are some updates planned for the close releases - more SQL snippets, frm, rpt files support.

Stay tuned.

Oh, and if you want to contact me, feel free: anton@zujev.eu. The package is free to use, modify and distribute. You can even sell it if you so wish. But do let me know about that. :)

Special thanks to Antonio Pérez (https://github.com/skarcha) for giving me the inspiration to use more regex in my snippets.

## Changes and updates:

### 2013-01-31
Deleted everything and reuploaded. Lots of small changed throughout the files. All tabs swapped for spaces. Some new snippets added. Check out my other repos - I've just finished a fairly useful plugin for creating a table of contents of your functions.

Additionaly, I don't have time to be updating a separate public 4GL branch, so everything in this repo is the stuff we use in our company. Thus, there are some function names and some syntax highlighting that will only make sence in our environment. If you need to adjust the stuff for your case and don't know how, drop me a line, I'll do my best to help you out.

### 2012-03-02
More love for forms. The package now recognizes them. Nothing more - some syntax highlighting and stuff. Will have to improve later.

### 2012-03-01
Added an MIT license statement to the README.

### 2012-02-29
By request, added a note about taking inspiration from Antonio Pérez (https://github.com/skarcha).
